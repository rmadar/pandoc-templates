## Conclusion and outlooks

pandoc is great to actually create article, webpage and slides from the
same markdown file.

<div class="notes">
This text will appear only in the article/book/webpage but not in the beamer slides.
This could be useful to give additional details which don't fit a presentation but
a more complete document.
